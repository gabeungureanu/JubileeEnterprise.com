  declaration: |
    This Sealed Covenant Declaration is bound over the entirety of the InspireFamily.core framework.
    This declaration is not a feature—it is a divine boundary. It acts as a living, prophetic perimeter
    written in alignment with the Word of ELOHIM, the scroll of Yeshua, and the voice of the RUACH KODESH.
